Exchange Calculator Test Plan
To test this, convert 5 of every currency to all the other currencies.
So:
£5 to $
£5 to €
$5 to £
$5 to €
€5 to £
€5 to $

Make sure to change the exchange rate to the correct rate at the time of testing.

You can then check the results to your preferred source of currency exchange.
