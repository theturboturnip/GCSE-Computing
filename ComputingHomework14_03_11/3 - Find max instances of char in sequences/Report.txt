1. The Objective
   For this program, I need to make a program that does the following:
       Takes in 1 character and 5 sequences of numbers.
       Look for the character in the 5 sequences.
       Tell me the maximum amount of times the character occured in
       the 5 sequences.
   For example, it might take in 'g',
   'g','gg','ggg','gggg','ggggg'. This would make it output 5.
   
2. The Test
   To test the program, I will run it 3 times, with these inputs:
   1.'g','g','gg','ggg','gggg','ggggg'. This should make it output 5.
   2.'z','abba','abza','azza','azzz','zzzz'. This should make it
     output 4.
   3.'m','a','b','c','d','e'. This should make it output 0.
3. Writing the code
   First, I looked on the internet for how to get every char in a
   string. I then found a function that called a function for every
   character in a string. I then implemented that, and also wrote a
   function that would be called with every character in a line. After
   that, it looked fine.
4. The testing
   I ran the program 3 times, and this is what came out.
   1.'g','g','gg','ggg','gggg','ggggg'. This made it output 5.
   2.'z','abba','abza','azza','azzz','zzzz'. This made it output 4.
   3.'m','a','b','c','d','e'. This made it output 0.
The test succeded. I can therefore conclude that I have finished the objective.
