1. The Objective
   For this program, I need to make a program that does the following:
       Takes in 2 filenames and 2 words.
       Replace all occurences of the first word in the first file by
       the second word.
       Write the result into the second text file.
   For example, it might take in 'file1.txt', 'file2.txt',
   'self-destruction', 'explosion'. This would then look through
   'file1.txt' for the word 'self-destruction', and then change it to
   'explosion'. It would then write the result to 'file2.txt'.
2. The Test
   To test the program, I will run it 3 times, with these inputs:
   1.'file1.txt','file2.txt','leave','stay'. This should make
     file2.txt read 'Please stay on the ship. A self-destruction is imminent.'
   2.'file1.txt','file2.txt','stay','sit'. This should make file2.txt
     read 'Please leave the ship. A self-detruction is imminent.'
   3.'file2.txt','flibble.txt'. This should make the program return an
     error, complaining about the fact that 'flibble.txt' does not
     exist.
3. Writing the code
   After I wrote a basic program that opened 2 text files,
   I added a for loop after the code that opened the files. This would
   go through every line in the first file and send it to the function
   'findreplace()'. I then made 'findreplace' split the line at every
   space, checked if the line was one of the things it had to replace,
   and if so, replaced it. It then added them all together and
   returned the result. After adding some code to write the result
   into the second file, it seemed to work.
4. The testing
   I ran the program 3 times, and this is what came out.
   1.'file1.txt','file2.txt','leave','stay'. This made file2.txt read 
     'Please stay on the ship. A self-destruction is imminent.'
   2.'file1.txt','file2.txt','stay','sit'. This made file2.txt read
     'Please leave the ship. A self-detruction is imminent.'
   3.'file2.txt','flibble.txt'. This made the program return an
     error, complaining about the fact that 'flibble.txt' does not
     exist.
