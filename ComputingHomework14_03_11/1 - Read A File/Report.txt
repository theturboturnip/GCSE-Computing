1. The Objective
   For this program, I need to make a program that does the following:
       Takes in a filename.
       Prints the contents.
   For example, it might take in 'file1.txt', then it would print
   'FILE1', the contents of 'file1.txt'.
2. The Test
   To test the program, I will run it 5 times, with these inputs:
   1.'file1.txt' This should make the program print 'FILE1'
   2.'file2.txt' This should make the program print 'I AM FILE DOS'
   3.'file3.txt' This should make the program print 'There are
                                                     5
                                                     files. I am the third.'
   4.'file4.txt' This should make the program print 'I am number
                                                     FOUR.'
   5.'file5.txt' This should make the program print 
     'This is the final file, or file 5.'
3. Writing the code
   First I wrote a program that opened a text file. I then made it
   print all the lines. Very simple.
4. The testing
   I ran the program 5 times, and this is what came out.
   1.'file1.txt' This made the program print 'FILE1'
   2.'file2.txt' This made the program print 'I AM FILE DOS'
   3.'file3.txt' This made the program print 'There are
                                                     5
                                                     files. I am the third.'
   4.'file4.txt' This made the program print 'I am number
                                                     FOUR.'
   5.'file5.txt' This made the program print 'This is the final file, or file 5.'
The test succeded. I can therefore conclude that I have finished the objective.
